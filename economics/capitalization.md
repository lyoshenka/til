# Capitalization

Capitalization is when the costs of buying or owning something are included in the price of that thing. For example, if a ball costs $10 to
buy online and shipping that ball to your house costs $2, then the capitalized cost of the ball is $12.

## Example: Property Tax Capitalization

> Property taxes are said to be capitalized into house values if, all else equal, a higher property tax payment leads to a lower house value.
> If the value of a house is $1 lower whenever the present value of the stream of property tax payments on the house is $1 higher, then
> property taxes are said to be fully capitalized into house values; in other words, the degree of tax capitalization is 100%.
