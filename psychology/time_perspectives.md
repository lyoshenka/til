# Time Perspectives

## Brief

People can by roughly grouped into types based on how their time perspectives. Some people are primarily focused on the past, with mostly positive
or mostly negative associations. Others are present-focused, and may be subdivided into present-fatalistic and present-hedonistic types.
Finally, some people are primarily future-oriented, which may be a mundane future (e.g. accomplishing goals) or a transcendent future (e.g.
heaven, the afterlife). Each perspective has benefits and drawbacks. Knowing a person's dominant perspective can help you understand them
better.

## Summary of Types

### Past-Oriented people:

- They are generally more concerned with their past and seem to be able to distance themselves from the realities of the present or the future.
- They usually tend to be traditional, religious, and conservative.
- They have a stable sense of self.
- They usually tend to be family- and group-oriented and are distrustful of strangers; thus they may have a tendency to be prejudiced.
- They usually focus on their obligations and commitments whether personal or collective (i.e. family, cultural, or tribal obligations).
- Rituals and myths play important roles in their lives.
- They may have guilt as a dominant feeling.
- They usually try to maintain the status quo and thus may not be progressive.
- They usually do not take risks and are not adventurous.
- Within their group, they usually tend to be dependent and cooperative rather than competitive.

### Present-Oriented People

- They tend to focus on the present and their current sensations, feelings, and concerns while ignoring commitments made in the past or for the future; thus they are more concerned with "what is" than "what was" or "what may be".
- Their thinking is more concrete rather than abstract (i.e. one hundred dollar right now is much better than two hundred dollars in the future).
- It is difficult for them to give up temptations or delay gratification and thus they are easily distracted from the performance of necessary current tasks and tend to be procrastinators.
- They tend to concentrate on activities that bring pleasure and avoid pain.
- Their knowledge or insight may not deter them from performing actions that may not be beneficial to them.
- They are usually more sensation and novelty seekers, more aggressive, more depressed, less conscientious, and less emotionally stable. They have less concern for future consequences, less ego and impulse control, and less preference for consistency. They also tend to lie.
- Usually people who are poor or uneducated tend to be present-oriented since they usually tend to focus on emergent needs of the present.
- Since they are not good in abstract thinking, are more concerned with immediate gratification, and less concerned about the future, they usually tend to get low grades in school.
- Because they are immediate pleasure seekers, they usually don't pay good attention to their health and can additionally abuse substances.
- They are usually considered to be fun people to be around.

### Future-Oriented People

- They are more focused on their future than the present or the past; their thoughts are concerned with the future consequences of their present actions; they logically analyze various outcomes that may result from their action.
- They are goal-oriented and can delay gratification and endure an unpleasant situation in order to achieve long-term goals. They pay attention to responsibility, liability, efficiency, distant payoffs, and tend to optimize future outcomes. Thus they can work hard and avoid temptations, distractions, waste of time to accomplish a goal. They usually tend to rehearse various future plans.
- Since they are concerned about the future, they tend to save their money and resources.
- They could be either cooperative or competitive depending on which action results in the best outcome.
- They tend to be health-conscious in order to prevent future negative health outcomes.
- They may be unable to enjoy fun activities due to the fear of wasting time.
- They may have difficulty in intimate relationships since they thrive on control, predictability, and consistency, factors that may interfere with the freedom and spontaneity of relationships.
- Although they usually have low anxiety levels, concern for the future may increase their anxiety. They usually tend to be workaholic, and have midlife crises.
- They tend to be more conscientious, less aggressive, less depressed, more reward-dependent, less sensation seeker, more studious, more creative, and use less addictive drugs and alcohol.
- They tend to have more self-esteem, energy, openness, ego-control, and grade-point average.
